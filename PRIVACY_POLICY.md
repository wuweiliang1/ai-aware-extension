## 1. Introduction

AI Bookmark Finder ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we DON'T do:

- ❌ We do NOT collect or store your personal information
- ❌ We do NOT track your browsing history
- ❌ We do NOT upload your bookmarks to our servers
- ❌ We do NOT use analytics or tracking cookies
- ❌ We do NOT sell or share your data with third parties
- ❌ We do NOT have our own servers - there's nothing to collect data to

## 3. Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:

- **API Configuration:** Your chosen AI provider (DeepSeek, OpenAI, or custom), API keys, and custom endpoints
- **User Preferences:** Language settings, tab behavior options
- **Search History:** Recent search queries for quick access

All this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to us.

## 4. Third-Party AI Services

When you use AI-powered search features, the extension communicates directly with your chosen AI provider:

### Data Sent to AI Providers:
- Your search query (the intent you type)
- Titles and URLs of your bookmarks

### Supported AI Providers:
- **DeepSeek:** [Privacy Policy](https://www.deepseek.com/privacy-policy)
- **OpenAI:** [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- **Custom Endpoints:** Subject to your organization's privacy policy

**Important:** Data is sent directly from your browser to the AI provider. We are not an intermediary and do not see, store, or process this data.

## 5. Local Matching Mode

You can use the extension in "Local Matching" mode, which:

- ✅ Works completely offline
- ✅ Does not send any data to external services
- ✅ Performs all matching locally in your browser
- ✅ Requires no API key or internet connection

## 6. Permissions Explained

### Bookmarks Permission
Required to read your bookmarks for matching. We only read - never modify, delete, or upload bookmarks.

### Storage Permission
Required to save your settings and preferences locally in your browser.

### Tabs Permission
Required to check if bookmarks are already open and to activate or open tabs.

### Host Permissions
Required to communicate with AI APIs and to compare tab URLs for smart tab management. We do not access page content or inject scripts.

## 7. Data Security

- API keys are stored securely using Chrome's encrypted storage
- All communication with AI providers uses HTTPS encryption
- No data is stored on external servers
- You can delete all stored data by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser data

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information, please contact us.
